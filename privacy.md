# Privacy

We take your privacy very seriously, and take numerous steps to avoid the breach of your data.

Here are some steps we take to do this:
* the program uses authentication from a Google account, which is much safer than a username and password once multi-factor authentication is enabled
* your questions are encrypted, meaning that no other accounts and not even we can view your account's information†
* the site uses HTTPS by default to encrypt traffic incoming and outgoing from the web server to your device
* we use a reputable payment gateway, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), which takes steps to ensure the security of your payment option

† This excludes data used to identify users on the service, including but not limited to your email address, name, profile picture and amount of storage used. If you have opted in to the leaderboard, it also excludes overall data about your studies, which are used to be displayed on the leaderboard, such as the number of questions answered and your overall percentage across every subject combined.
