# Pricing

In order to maintain Ensure to a sufficient level of stability, as well as making it viable in the long-term, we are unfortunately unable to provide it for free.

However, we do not want to price out people unable to pay large amounts of money from being able to benefit from the program.

As a result, there is a flat fee of **59p per month** to use the service. We believe that this is almost universally affordable, and will not prevent people from being able to use the service. Since the payment fees on smaller charges take up a larger proportion of the total cost, the price decreases if you purchase more months at once.

This fee allows you to upload up to **10,000 questions**, which we believe is a more than sufficient amount for almost every purpose.

A **7-day free trial** begins as soon as you sign up, so that you can try out Ensure and see if it works for you.

There is a **7-day grace period** where you will still be able to use Ensure and download all of your information, including your questions; you may then upload these again to the service if you choose to restart your subscription. After this point, your information will be permanently deleted from the servers.

This money goes into paying for the following:
* the storage of your questions
* the hosting of the website
* the cost of the domain name
* the transaction fees
