# Using The Service

## Creating a Subject

To create a subject, you can simply click the `New` button on the overview page. From here, you will be prompted to choose a theme, and set up the topics and subtopics. You will also be asked to enter the average grade boundaries for the subject, so that it can generate an estimate of the grade you are working at.

At this stage, you can also provide links to your online notes for the entire subject, each topic and/or each subtopic if you would like, making it easier to get to them.
