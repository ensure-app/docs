# About

Ensure allows you to host individual past papers and their questions, uploaded by yourself, sorted by *subject*, *topic* and *subtopic*, which are served to you in an order based on how the difficulty of these subtopics has changed. Given an appropriate number of questions answered, the program will begin to have an idea of how you are performing over time in particular subtopics, giving you suggestions on which to work on, as well as an indicator of the overall percentage you are working at for the particular subject. As you complete the questions, it will also update the mark on the papers the questions are from (known as *sources*).

It is currently a website, designed for both desktop and mobile devices, however a mobile application is currently being developed.

Completing questions on Ensure works differently to doing so using past papers in that it gives you individual questions, rather than the entire paper, to do at once. Once you have answered the question, you can reveal the mark scheme for the question, and give yourself a mark. Therefore, it is possible to do questions from papers one at a time, knowing which questions you are yet to complete, meaning that you are not obliged to sit down and do a whole past paper, and can instead to questions in short bursts, wherever you are.

It serves **_three_** main purposes:
* to act as a place to store past papers and their marks, removing the need for complex and non-dynamic spreadsheets
* to provide questions on subtopics where you are struggling more frequently than others, to improve the marks in these areas
* to show areas where increases in attainment are slowing, which should be reviewed

As a result of the questions being sorted by subtopic, it is possible to answer questions based on individual subtopics if you would like to do questions from these, such as if you have a timetable for doing specific topics.
