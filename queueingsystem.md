# Queueing System

The program will always prioritise questions which you have not yet done, to prevent you being repeatedly served the same questions.

The exception is for questions where you have scored below a defined percentage on (with a default of 75%); these will be given to you at a defined frequency (a default of every two weeks) until you score above this percentage, at which point it will be given to you after a longer period (a default of two months). After this point, if you have scored at least the defined percentage, it will be filed back into the review cycle.

Once you have completed all of the saved questions for the first time, it will serve you questions which you obtain worse marks on with a higher frequency than those with higher marks, so that these can be improved.
